Installation
------------

1 - Install the plugin.

The easiest way to install `sfUserVoicePlugin` is to use the symfony command line:

    > php symfony plugin:install sfUserVoicePlugin

However recommended method is to fork the latest package from my git hub [https://github.com/zdanozdan/sfUserVoicePluing]

2 - Register feedback on uservoice.com and get key, host and forum parameters.

3 - Configure app.yml

  >  sf_user_voice_plugin:
  >    key:                  my key from uservoice
  >    host:                 my serive address on uservoice
  >    forum:                my forum id

Those 3 are required to put in user app.yml config. Plugin however have more params to config in plugin/config directory and they can be user do further configure the plugin but they have default values

      >  sf_user_voice_plugin:
      >    key:                  
      >    host: 
      >    forum:
      >    alignment:              right	
      >    background_color:       f00 
      >    text_color:             white
      >    hover_color:            06c
      >    show_tab:               true
      >    lang:                   en
      >    params:                 
      >    no_dialog:              false

4 - Clear the cache to enable the autoloading to find the new classes:

    > php symfony cc

5 - Use helper to display javascript

In the template you can use UserVoiceHelper do bind popup feedback

   > use_helper('UserVoice');
   > echo add_user_voice($sf_user->getCulture())
